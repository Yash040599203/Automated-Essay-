Techniques Used:
Regression Analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships
between the dependent variables or criterion variables and one or more
independent variables or predictors. Regression analysis explains the changes in
criteria in relation to changes in select predictors. The conditional expectation of
the criterions based on predictors where the average value of the dependent
variables is given when the independent variables are changed.
A regression problem is when the output variable is a real or continuous value,
such as “salary” or “weight” or “marks”, it tries to fit the data with the best
hyperplane which goes through the points.
