# Automated-Essay-

As testing programs move away from multiple-choice items, the incorporation of
an increasing number of constructed-response items in tests becomes inevitable.
Essays items, are becoming more and more common in large - scale testing
programs . Human assessment is expected as more time consuming, inconsistent
and costly . Essays and writings assessed by computer models have less chances of
making errors and have more reliable scores. Still there are few shortcomings/
problems.
To address these problems , we will analyse and implement several machine
learning algorithms and estimate the most suitable algorithm or two, to
automatically score the essays. Thereby saving human labor , time and money .
Disadvantages of Existing System-
The existing system implements linear regression model to learn from these
features and generate parameters for testing and validation.
1. Lack of autocorrelation : Gauss Markov method states that linear model assumes
that errors are uncorrelated.
2. Homoscedastic (variance independent of point)
3. Non-multicollinearity
